Make every AI coding agent work by the best harness.

Git-native management of skills, rules, MCP, env vars, knowledge base, and more — across Claude Code / Codex / CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy / OpenCode and more.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g teamai-cli
```

### Team admin / solo user

Create a shared-experience repo on your git host (GitHub, GitLab, CNB, TGit, or a private Git service), **grant write access to team members**, then run `teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo`.

> **No team repo yet?** Start from a template pre-loaded with production-ready skills, rules, and review agents. Browse the [teamai-hub](https://github.com/teamai-hub) org, click **Use this template**, then `teamai init` against your new repo.

### Team members

```bash
# Choose one, depending on where you want resources installed

# Project-scope init (default, resources installed under the project directory)
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo

# Or, user-scope init (resources installed under ~/)
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo --scope user
```

Once initialized, every AI session automatically pulls the latest skills / rules and other Harness updates published by admins — no manual sync needed.

> **Full usage guide:** [docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md) ([中文版](docs/usage-guide.zh-CN.md)) — covers everything from team creation to day-to-day use.

### Distribution Controls

Team-wide settings an admin configures once and delivers to every member on `teamai pull`:

| Capability | Command | What it does |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Roles** | `teamai roles` | Define role → namespace mappings so each member syncs only the skills for their role. |
| **Tags** | `teamai tags` | Tag skills / rules so members subscribe to just the tags they need. |
| **Sources** | `teamai source` | Subscribe to additional skill repos — other teams' public repos, or shared/public repos within your own org; subscribed skills sync automatically on pull. |

### Analytics

Insight into how the team actually uses its AI tools:

| Capability | Command | What it shows |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Usage** | `teamai digest` | Weekly team digest — token usage, conversation volume, and intervention rate. |
| **Sessions** | `teamai session save` | Privacy-scrubbed per-session summaries (tool sequence, prompt turns, interventions) that feed the digest's Session Highlights. |
| **Dashboard** | `teamai dashboard` | Web dashboard showing team members' live coding-session status, intervention count, and token usage. |

## Harness Management & Distribution

TeamAI keeps skills, rules, docs, and hooks in a shared git repo and distributes them to every member's local AI tools through a "push → review & merge → pull" flow — with support for subscribing to other teams' or shared repos' Harness.

### How It Works

```
teamai push → create branch + MR → reviewer approves + merges
                                         ↓
              SessionStart hook → teamai pull → synced to local AI tools
```

Members push changes via `teamai push`, which opens a Merge Request for review. Re-running `teamai push` on a resource that is still waiting in an unmerged PR updates that PR in place instead of opening a duplicate. Once merged, `teamai pull` (triggered automatically on session start via the SessionStart hook) syncs the latest resources locally. Skills sync to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.codebuddy/skills/`, etc. In a **project-scope** install, SessionStart first creates that tool's project root (e.g. `<project>/.claude`) if it is missing, then pulls into it — a bare `teamai pull` still will not invent agent directories.

### Team Hooks

Declare custom hooks in `hooks/hooks.yaml` and `teamai pull` delivers them to every AI tool:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: block-secret
    description: Scan for secrets before commit
    event: PreToolUse
    matcher: Bash
    command: 'bash -lc "~/.teamai/team-scripts/scan-secret.sh" || true'
    tools: [claude, cursor]
```

```bash
teamai hooks list      # list effective hooks
teamai hooks inject    # re-reconcile into every installed tool
teamai hooks remove    # remove all teamai-managed hooks
```

### Team MCP Servers

Declare once in `mcp/mcp.yaml`; `teamai pull` writes each tool's native config. Use `${VAR}` for secrets.

```yaml
servers:
  - name: gpu-analysis
    transport: http            # stdio | http | sse
    url: https://example.com/api/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${GPU_ANALYSIS_TOKEN}
```

```bash
teamai mcp list | inject | remove
```

### Skill Subscription Sources

Subscribe to additional skill repos — other teams' public repos, or shared/public repos within your own org:

```bash
teamai source add https://github.com/other-team/teamai-public.git --name other-team
teamai source list
teamai source browse other-team    # browse available skills
teamai source remove other-team
```

The add/remove change takes effect locally right away, and subscribed skills sync on the next
`teamai pull`. Run `teamai push` when you want to share the `teamai.yaml` change with teammates.

## Knowledge Base

Beyond distributing the Harness, TeamAI organizes accumulated team experience and code structure into a searchable knowledge base that the AI recalls automatically when needed.

### Automatic Experience Sharing

When a session ends, the Stop hook scores it by **friction** — signals that the session hit something worth remembering: you interrupted or corrected the AI, denied a tool call, or the AI had to retry failing tools. A long-but-routine session (lots of tool calls, no friction) does not trigger; a session where you actually fought a problem does. If the score is high enough, the AI suggests:

```
[teamai] This session may contain a problem worth documenting: you interrupted the AI twice, the AI retried failing tools 8 times.

Task: Fix duplicate project-level Hook injection

Consider running /teamai-share-learnings to summarize what you learned and share it with your team.
```

The hint names the non-zero friction signals that triggered it and, when available, includes a redacted, single-line summary of the first task. The `/teamai-share-learnings` skill summarizes the session and pushes a learning document directly to the team repo. Each session is prompted at most once.

### Team Knowledge Recall

Let the AI automatically search accumulated team knowledge before a task. This feature is **off by default** and must be enabled explicitly — teams can set `sharing.recall.enabled: true` in `teamai.yaml` as the default, and members can override locally:

```bash
teamai recall enable     # on: deploy the teamai-recall subagent + inject guidance rules
teamai recall disable    # off: remove the subagent and rules
teamai recall status     # show effective state (team default + user override)
```

**Search runs via a subagent**: once enabled, `teamai pull` deploys the built-in `teamai-recall` subagent into each AI tool's `agents/` directory. The AI invokes it before a task — the subagent extracts keywords, runs the search, reads the matched source files, and returns a structured summary of team knowledge. The subagent first runs a relevance precheck (`teamai recall --check`) and skips retrieval entirely when the task is unrelated to team knowledge. Under the hood it shells out to the `teamai recall` command, which you can also run manually:

```bash
$ teamai recall "port conflict"
[1/2] MR review caught a port-conflict bug ★1 [user]
Author: member-a | Score: 18.5 | Tags: troubleshooting, networking

[2/2] Deployment configuration best practices [project]
Author: member-b | Score: 12.0 | Tags: deploy, config
Matched: conflict | Missing: port
```

### Codebase Knowledge Graph

`teamai import` parses source repos into a structured graph under `teamwiki/`, enabling structurally-aware retrieval:

```bash
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo
teamai import --from-org myorg              # batch import all repos
teamai codebase --lint                      # health check
```

The graph stores components, interfaces, configs, and cross-repo import edges. `teamai recall` uses it for graph-boosted re-ranking.
When a recall hit comes from a codebase page, the result includes a `Sources:` line listing the relevant source file paths — giving agents a direct starting point for code changes instead of re-exploring the repo.

Edges come from two tracks that run together, with AST results taking precedence on overlap:

- **AST track** (TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go): a WASM [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) parser resolves `import`/`require`, call sites, and TS `implements` clauses to precise file-to-file `DEPENDS_ON` / `REFERENCES` / `IMPLEMENTS` edges (tagged `code-ast`, with confidence weights).
- **Heuristic track** (all languages, including Java/Rust): regex-based extraction (tagged `code-heuristic`), which also covers languages the AST track does not.

The WASM parser is a pure-JavaScript dependency — no native toolchain is required. If it fails to load for any reason, extraction falls back to the heuristic track and records an `AST_UNAVAILABLE` gap. Set `TEAMAI_SKIP_AST=1` to force heuristic-only extraction.
