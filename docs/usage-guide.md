## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|------|------|
| **Team Repo** | A Git repository that centrally stores a team's shared Skills / Rules / Docs / Env resources |
| **Scope** | Where resources are installed: `project` (current project, default) or `user` (home directory) |
| **Skills** | Custom skills the AI can invoke (a directory containing a `SKILL.md`) |
| **Rules** | Markdown-formatted team conventions, automatically merged into AI tool configs |
| **Docs** | Shared team documentation for the AI to reference |
| **Env** | Shared team environment variables, automatically injected into the shell |

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g teamai-cli

# Verify
teamai --version
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, Git (TGit users also need the `gf` CLI, and CNB users the `cnb` CLI — `teamai init` installs either automatically)

---

## Admin Initialization

> Only one admin needs to do this — other members can skip to [Member Onboarding](#member-onboarding).

Create an empty repository on GitHub, GitLab (gitlab.com or a self-hosted instance), CNB (cnb.cool), TGit (Tencent's internal Git host), or any private/self-hosted Git service (suggested naming: `TeamAi-<team-name>`), or simply run `teamai init` — if the repo doesn't exist yet, you'll be prompted to create it automatically.

### Project Scope (default)

Resources are installed under the project directory (`<project>/.claude/skills/`, etc.), suited for project-specific skills and rules.

```bash
# project is the default — --scope can be omitted
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init <group>/TeamAi-<team>
# equivalent alias: teamai init --repo <group>/TeamAi-<team>
```

Resulting directory structure:

```
/path/to/my-project/
├── .teamai/                     # Project-level config (with an auto-generated .gitignore)
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── team-repo/
├── .claude/skills/              # Project-level skills (auto-synced)
├── .claude/rules/               # Project-level rules (auto-synced)
└── src/
```

`teamai init` writes `.teamai/` only. Per-agent project roots (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codebuddy/`, …) are created on **SessionStart** for the tool that just opened (`--tool claude` creates `.claude/`, then pull writes into it). A bare `teamai pull` still skips tools whose project root does not exist, so it never invents agent directories for tools you have not opened in this project.

If the repo has role-based skills enabled (i.e. `manifest/roles.yaml` exists), `teamai init` will also interactively ask you to choose:

- `primaryRole`: the target namespace for skill sync and push by default
- `additionalRoles`: additional skill namespaces to sync

You can also skip the interactive prompts via CLI flags for a fully non-interactive init (suitable for CI/CD or AI agents):

```bash
teamai init <group>/TeamAi-<team> --scope project --role hai_dev --force
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|------|
| `[repo]` / `--repo <url>` | Team repo URL (positional preferred; `--repo` is a permanent alias) |
| `--scope <project\|user>` | Install scope, defaults to `project` (`<cwd>/.teamai`). Use `user` for `~/` |
| `--inherit-user-scope` | Project scope only: also sync safe user resources and search user knowledge |
| `--no-inherit-user-scope` | Disable previously configured user-scope inheritance for this project |
| `--role <id>` | Directly specify the primary role, skipping the interactive role prompt |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing config, skipping confirmation prompts |

Example local config:

```yaml
repo:
  localPath: /path/to/my-project/.teamai/team-repo
  remote: https://github.com/group/repo.git
username: alice
scope: project
projectRoot: /path/to/my-project
inheritUserScope: true            # optional; project scope only
primaryRole: hai
additionalRoles:
  - pm
resourceProfileVersion: 1
```

### User Scope

Resources are installed into your home directory (`~/.claude/skills/`, etc.), suited for general team conventions and cross-project skills.

```bash
teamai init <group>/TeamAi-<team> --scope user
```

Resulting directory structure:

```
~/.teamai/
├── config.yaml          # Local config
├── team-repo/            # Clone of the team repo
│   ├── teamai.yaml      # Remote team config
│   ├── skills/ rules/ docs/ env/ members/
│   ├── manifest/roles.yaml  # Role definitions (when role-based skills are enabled)
│   └── learnings/       # Team knowledge base
~/.claude/skills/        # Team skills (auto-synced)
~/.claude/rules/         # Team rules (auto-synced)
```

### How to Choose a Scope?

| Dimension | Project Scope (default) | User Scope |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Install location** | Under the project directory | Under `~/` |
| **Best for** | Project-specific skills and rules | General team conventions, cross-project skills |
| **Can coexist** | ✅ Yes; project stays active and can opt into safe user resources | ✅ Yes; remains a separate home-level install |

> **Local install location** is decided only by `teamai init`'s `--scope` (default `project`). A `scope` field in remote `teamai.yaml`, if present, is ignored.

### Single-repo mode (business repo is the team repo)

Instead of a separate team repo, you can make an existing project's own git repo double as the team repo. Run this inside the project:

```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init .                        # interactive: pick which AI tools to set up
teamai init . --agent claude,codex   # non-interactive: set up Claude Code + Codex
```

**Choosing which AI tools to set up.** Single-repo mode creates a per-tool directory in your repo (e.g. `.claude/`, `.codex/`) — it seeds the skills dir, injects the teamai hooks, and commits that tool's settings to main so teammates get them on clone. You control which tools:

- **`--agent <name...>`** — explicit list, repeatable or comma-separated: `--agent claude`, `--agent claude,codex`, `--agent claude --agent cursor`. Supported ids: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `codebuddy`, `workbuddy`, `dsh` (DeepSeek Harness).
- **Interactive (no `--agent`, a terminal)** — teamai shows a multi-select. Option 1 is **Auto**, which lists the AI tools already installed on your machine (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, …) and is the Enter default; the remaining options are the individual tools. Auto and specific tools can be combined.
- **Non-interactive (no `--agent`, no terminal — CI, hooks, clone-time bootstrap)** — teamai mirrors the tools you already use under your home dir (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, …). If none are found, it creates nothing (you still get the knowledge; run `teamai init .` later to pick tools).

**How it splits data across branches:**

| Data | Where it lives | Travels with `git clone`? |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Knowledge: `skills/` `rules/` `docs/` `learnings/`, `teamai.yaml` | `.teamai/` on the **main** branch | ✅ Yes |
| Reports: `members/` `sessions/` `votes/` `stats/` | `teamai-reports` **orphan branch** | Pushed to `origin` (separate history) |
| Machine-local: `config.yaml`, `token`, `state.json`, worktrees | `.teamai/` (gitignored) | ❌ No (per-machine) |

**Clone = initialized.** Because knowledge and the `mode: self` marker in `.teamai/teamai.yaml` are committed to main, a teammate who clones the repo is auto-initialized: the next `teamai` command or AI session detects the marker, and (when their git provider is already authenticated) writes their local config, injects hooks, and registers them on the reports branch — no need to re-type repo/role. If they aren't authenticated yet, teamai prompts them to run `teamai init .` once.

**Safety.** Every git write teamai performs in single-repo mode (knowledge PRs and the reports orphan branch) runs in an isolated git worktree under `.teamai/`. Your working tree and current branch are never checked out, reset, or switched.

**Admin checklist after `teamai init .`:**

1. `teamai init .` already commits `.teamai/` (skills, rules, docs, learnings, `teamai.yaml`, `.gitignore`) plus each selected tool's settings (e.g. `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`) to the current branch for you.
2. Push main so teammates can clone.
3. Add resources later with `teamai push` — it opens a PR against your repo (via an isolated worktree) rather than committing to your working tree. In single-repo mode you can author them either in an AI tool dir (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/`) **or** by dropping them straight into `.teamai/` in your repo:
   - `.teamai/skills/` — team skills
   - `.teamai/rules/` — shared rules
   - `.teamai/agents/` — subagent definitions (`<name>.yaml`, or legacy `<name>.md`)
   - `.teamai/env/env.yaml` — shared env vars

   `teamai push` scans all of these plus your AI tool dirs, and only surfaces genuine additions or edits (already-committed content is skipped). If you rename an agent's extension (e.g. `helper.md` → `helper.yaml`), delete the old file — `teamai push` won't remove it for you, and two files with the same stem would collide on pull.
4. **docs / hooks / mcp** are contributed by editing their file directly — they don't go through `teamai push`; a normal `git commit` + push ships them:
   - `.teamai/docs/` — team docs
   - `.teamai/hooks/hooks.yaml` — team hooks
   - `.teamai/mcp/mcp.yaml` — shared MCP servers

> **Heads-up on `env`.** In single-repo mode `.teamai/env/env.yaml` **is committed to main** (unlike standalone mode's per-machine env), so it travels to everyone who clones the repo. `env.yaml` stores plaintext key/value pairs — put only non-secret shared config there, and keep real secrets in your own untracked environment.

> **Limitation.** Single-repo mode ties one team setup to one business repo. If you need to share one team knowledge base across many business repos, use a standalone team repo (`teamai init <repo>`) instead.

### Layer an organization repo under a project repo

Use two Team Repos when some knowledge is organization-wide and other resources are project-specific. The CLI is installed only once, but each scope has its own local config and repository clone:

```bash
# Once per developer: organization-wide skills, rules, docs, agents, and learnings
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/engineering-practices --scope user

# In a Java project: project resources stay active and recall prefers them
cd /path/to/java-service
teamai init https://github.com/yourorg/java-service-teamai --inherit-user-scope
```

With inheritance enabled, `teamai pull` refreshes user `skills`, `rules`, `docs`, `agents`, shared instructions/culture, and the user search index in their home-level locations, then refreshes the project scope in the project directory. User `env`, hooks, MCP definitions, cross-team sources, usage reporting, and remote repository writes are not inherited. The two configs and repositories remain separate; this feature composes their safe read paths rather than merging Git repositories or files. Installed resources with the same name remain in separate user/project paths, so the AI tool decides runtime precedence; Recall separately guarantees that a project entry shadows the same user resource type and filename.

---

## Member Onboarding

Once the admin shares the team repo URL with members:

**Project-scoped teams (default):**

```bash
npm install -g teamai-cli
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init <group>/TeamAi-<team>
# Done! AI tools now automatically have access to team resources
```

**User-scoped teams:**

```bash
npm install -g teamai-cli
teamai init <group>/TeamAi-<team> --scope user
```

**HTTP mode (read-only consumer):**

For users or agents that don't need git access and only consume skills/rules:

```bash
teamai init --http https://your-team-host/api --token <api-key>
```

- Read-only mode: `push` / `contribute` / `remove` are not available.
- No git clone required — skills/rules are delivered via a report/sync/ack lifecycle on a per-session basis.
- Supported agents automatically report their installed skill state at session start, and pull install/update/uninstall commands managed by the server.
- The API key is stored with `0600` permissions, or can be passed via the `TEAMAI_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

**Verify:**

```bash
teamai status                       # View status
teamai members                      # View team members
teamai list                         # All resource types (skills|rules|docs|env|agents|hooks|mcp) + local skills
teamai list mcp                     # Only team MCP servers
teamai list --source repo           # Team repo only
teamai list --source local          # Skills under each installed agent
teamai list --agent claude --verbose
teamai list env --reveal            # Show env values in plaintext (default: masked)

teamai skill                        # Equivalent to teamai list skills --source all
teamai skill show hai-deploy-test   # View a single skill's source / contributor / install locations / description summary
```

---

## Day-to-Day Use

### Auto-sync

`teamai init` already injected Hooks into your AI tools. **`teamai pull` runs automatically every time you start an AI session** — no manual action needed. In project scope, that SessionStart hook first creates the current agent's project root (e.g. `<project>/.claude` when Claude Code opens the repo) if it is missing, then pulls.

If you need to sync immediately, you can run it manually:

```bash
teamai pull              # Manual pull
teamai pull --dry-run    # Dry run, no actual changes
```

> Project scope is isolated by default. When the current working directory contains a project-scope `.teamai/config.yaml`, `pull` processes that project and skips user scope unless the local config has `inheritUserScope: true`; in that case it first refreshes the safe user-resource channel. Without a project config in the current directory, `pull` processes user scope. User `env`, MCP definitions, sources, reporting, and writes remain isolated in project mode. Hooks are the one exception: a project scope's hooks are injected into your **HOME** tool settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`, …), not `<projectRoot>`, because the built-in hooks gate on the `cwd` handed to `hook-dispatch` and `~/.claude` always exists so the "installed tool" gate passes (see the Hooks section). Self single-repo mode keeps its hooks in the business repo so they travel on clone.

With role-based skills enabled, `pull`'s skill sync source becomes the contents of `skills/<namespace>/`, expanded according to `primaryRole + additionalRoles` and flattened into each local AI tool's skills directory. `rules/`, `docs/`, and `learnings/` keep their original global sync behavior.

### Offline materialization for orchestrators

Automation that already governs the exact Skill list can use the separate, offline materialization contract instead of `init` or `pull`:

```bash
teamai-materialize \
  --request /sandbox/request.json \
  --input-root /sandbox/input \
  --output-root /sandbox/output \
  --result /sandbox/result.json
```

This path does not read TeamAI configuration, Git, HOME resources, hooks, MCP, sources, credentials, or analytics. It only copies an exhaustive, hash-pinned Skill request into a fresh private staging root and emits a deterministic result. It never chooses or writes a real AI-tool directory. See the [materialization protocol v1](materialize-v1.md) for schemas, path rules, limits, exit codes, and the caller's sandbox and independent-verification obligations.

### Excluding skills you don't need

If a skill shared by the team doesn't suit you, you can exclude it locally only — no need to modify the team repo, and it won't affect other members:

```bash
teamai skill exclude add using-superpowers
teamai pull                    # Remove it from local AI tools
teamai skill exclude list

teamai skill exclude remove using-superpowers
teamai pull                    # Re-sync
```

The exclusion list is stored in the `config.yaml` of the current user or project scope:

```yaml
excludedSkills:
  - using-superpowers
```

Exclusion rules take effect after role and tag filtering. When running `teamai pull`, excluded skills are not synced, and any copies previously installed by `pull` are cleaned up.

### Push local resources

```bash
teamai push          # Scan for new/modified resources, create an MR
teamai push --all    # Skip confirmation, push directly
teamai push --role pm  # Push this skill to skills/pm/<skill-name>/
```

**Namespace selection (new skills):** When pushing a new skill, the CLI automatically detects available namespaces and offers an interactive choice:

```
Which namespace should new skills be pushed to?
  1. common
  2. hai
  3. pm
Choose namespace [1-3] (default: 1 = common):
```

- If `primaryRole` is set, the list of available namespaces is expanded from the manifest
- If `primaryRole` is not set, the team repo's directory structure is scanned automatically
- A single namespace is auto-selected; `--silent` mode uses the default
- Modifying an existing skill automatically keeps its original namespace

**Updating an open PR instead of duplicating it:** If a resource is already waiting in an unmerged PR, re-running `teamai push` on it updates that existing PR in place (by force-pushing its branch) rather than opening a duplicate. Keep the resource selected to update its PR; deselect it to leave the PR untouched. Unrelated resources selected in the same run go into their own new PR. Once the PR merges (or its branch is removed from the remote), the record is cleared and the next push opens a fresh PR as usual.

**Automatic YAML frontmatter completion:** When pushing, the CLI automatically checks `SKILL.md` and fills in `name`/`description` if missing — no manual upkeep required.

### Check status

```bash
teamai status        # Current scope, last sync time, resource stats
```

### Role management

Roles control which skills each member sees. Admins define roles via `manifest/roles.yaml`; once a member selects their role, `pull` syncs skills from the matching namespace. Active tag subscriptions may additionally sync explicitly matching skills from other namespaces, but untagged skills in inactive namespaces are not included.

**Admin operations:**

```bash
# Initialize (interactively create the manifest)
teamai roles init

# Add a role
teamai roles add devops --namespaces common,infra -d "Infrastructure team"

# Update a role (add/remove namespaces, change description)
teamai roles update hai --add-namespaces infra
teamai roles update hai --remove-namespaces legacy -d "New description"

# Remove a role
teamai roles remove devops

# Preview changes
teamai roles add test --namespaces common,test --dry-run
```

The commands above automatically push a branch and create an MR; the change takes effect team-wide once merged.

**Member operations:**

```bash
# View available roles
teamai roles list

# Choose your own role
teamai roles set hai
teamai roles set hai --add pm    # Primary role hai + additional role pm

# Sync resources for the new role
teamai pull
```

> **Safe degradation:** If an admin removes a role that a member is still configured with, `pull` won't error out — it falls back to a full sync and prints a warning prompting the member to choose a new role.

## Sharing Team Resources

### Skills

```bash
# Create a skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-deploy-helper
cat > ~/.claude/skills/my-deploy-helper/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
# Deploy Helper
When the user requests a deployment, follow these steps:
1. Check that the current branch is master
2. Run tests `npm test`
3. Build `npm run build`
4. Deploy `./deploy.sh`
EOF

# Push to the team (YAML frontmatter is auto-completed)
teamai push

# Push to a specific role namespace
teamai push --role pm
```

> **Frontmatter auto-completion:** When pushing, the CLI checks the `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter (`name`/`description`) and, if missing, derives and fills it in automatically from the directory name and content. You can also add more precise frontmatter yourself:
>
> ```yaml
> ---
> name: my-deploy-helper
> description: Automated skill for helping the team deploy services
> tags: [deploy, automation]
> ---
> ```

With role-based skills enabled, the push target directory becomes:

- Default: `skills/<primaryRole>/<skill-name>/`
- Explicit override: `skills/<role>/<skill-name>/` (via `--role`)

### Rules

```bash
# Create a rule
cat > ~/.claude/rules/code-review-guide.md << 'EOF'
# Code Review Guidelines
- All functions must have JSDoc comments
- `any` type is not allowed
- Test coverage must be at least 80%
EOF

# Push
teamai push
```

> Admins can set enforced rules in `teamai.yaml` (`sharing.rules.enforced`), which members cannot delete.

### Env (environment variables)

```bash
teamai env add API_ENDPOINT https://api.example.com --description "Team API endpoint"
teamai env list
teamai push
```

### Docs

Place documentation in the team repo's `docs/` directory; after pushing, team members will automatically receive it on their next `pull`.

### MCP servers

Declare each server once in the team repo's `mcp/mcp.yaml`. On `teamai pull` it is written into every installed tool's own MCP config, translated into that tool's native format.

```yaml
servers:
  - name: gpu-analysis
    description: GPU inventory and pricing queries
    transport: http                      # stdio | http | sse
    url: https://example.com/api/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${GPU_ANALYSIS_TOKEN}
    timeout: 600000

  - name: local-formatter
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ['-y', '@acme/formatter-mcp']
    env:
      FORMATTER_MODE: strict
    requires: [npx]                      # skipped with a hint when npx is absent
    tools: [claude, cursor]              # optional; default is every capable tool
```

Where each tool's servers land:

| Tool | User scope | Project scope |
|---|---|---|
| claude | `~/.claude.json` | `<project>/.mcp.json` |
| cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| codebuddy / workbuddy | `~/.<tool>/mcp.json` | `<project>/.<tool>/mcp.json` |
| codex | `~/.codex/config.toml` | not supported |
| opencode | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` | `<project>/opencode.json` |

Codex supports `stdio` and `http`; `sse` is skipped. OpenCode supports `stdio` (written as its `type:"local"` shape) and `http` (`type:"remote"`); `sse` is skipped, and its servers live under the `mcp` key of the shared `opencode.json`. Ownership is tracked in `~/.teamai/managed-mcp.json` — hand-added servers are left alone; name collisions skip unless `--force`.

**Secrets.** Write `${VAR}`, never a literal, in `mcp.yaml`. Values resolve from the environment, then from `env/env.yaml` → `~/.teamai/env`. Unresolved variables skip the server with a hint.

teamai **resolves every `${VAR}` to its value and writes it verbatim** into each tool's config (new files are created `0600`). It does not rely on any tool's own env-var expansion: that expansion is fragile — most decisively, IDEs launched from the GUI (Dock/Launchpad) never inherit your shell's exported variables, so a `${VAR}` placeholder expands to empty and the server 401s. Resolving to plaintext makes the token present no matter how the tool is started.

> ⚠️ **The resolved token lands on disk.** Project-scope MCP configs (`.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.codebuddy/mcp.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `opencode.json`) then contain the literal secret — add them to `.gitignore` and never commit them.

Claude Code may show project `.mcp.json` servers as pending approval until you accept them once in an interactive session.

```bash
teamai mcp list              # servers, secret status, and where they are installed
teamai mcp inject            # apply now; --dry-run to preview, --force to override collisions
teamai mcp remove            # remove every teamai-managed server
```

## Knowledge Capture & Retrieval

### Contributing knowledge

The AI tracks your coding sessions via Hooks. When a session ends (the Stop hook), the system scores it by **friction** — whether you interrupted or corrected the AI, denied a tool call, or the AI had to retry failing tools. A long-but-routine session (many tool calls, no friction) won't trigger; only a session where you actually hit a problem does. If it qualifies, the AI automatically reminds you:

```
[teamai] This session may contain a problem worth documenting: you interrupted the AI twice, the AI retried failing tools 8 times.

Task: Fix duplicate project-level Hook injection

Consider running /teamai-share-learnings to summarize what you learned and share it with your team.
```

The reminder lists the non-zero friction signals that triggered it. When the first task is available, it also includes a redacted, single-line task summary so you can decide whether the session is worth sharing. Using the built-in `/teamai-share-learnings` skill, the AI will automatically summarize the session's learnings and contribute them to the team knowledge base. Each session is prompted at most once.

You can also specify a file manually:

```bash
teamai contribute --file /tmp/session.md
teamai contribute --file /tmp/session.md --scope project
```

### Searching knowledge

```bash
teamai recall "API timeout"
teamai recall "GPU out of memory"
```

- Supports mixed-language search
- Searches the project scope when the current working directory contains its config; with `inheritUserScope: true`, searches project first and user second, labeling results `[project]`/`[user]`. Otherwise searches user scope
- For the same resource type and filename, the project entry wins; different resource types with the same filename remain separate
- Consulted active-scope knowledge is automatically upvoted. Inherited user hits remain read-only while the project is active
- A lightweight relevance precheck is available via `teamai recall --check "<keywords>"`, which prints `RELEVANT score=<n> threshold=<n>` or `NOT_RELEVANT score=<n> threshold=<n>` without reading files or upvoting — the recall subagent uses it to skip retrieval on unrelated tasks. For a `RELEVANT` top hit it also reports `matched=`/`missing=` — the query terms that hit its title/tags and those that did not
- `RELEVANT` means a hit cleared the score threshold, i.e. reading files is worth the cost — it does not mean the knowledge base covers your subject. Use the `matched=`/`missing=` terms (and the `Matched:`/`Missing:` lines on full results) to make that judgement: a hit missing all your distinctive terms is topically adjacent, not an answer

### Enabling / Disabling Recall

The Recall feature is controlled by a two-tier configuration — admins set the team default, and members can override it locally:

| Tier | Config file | Field | Description |
|------|----------|------|------|
| Team default | `teamai.yaml` | `sharing.recall.enabled` | `true` / `false` (default `false`) |
| User override | `~/.teamai/config.yaml` | `recallEnabled` | `true` / `false`, takes priority over the team default |
| Environment variable | shell | `TEAMAI_RECALL_DISABLED=1` | Force-disables all recall hooks (emergency kill switch) |

```bash
teamai recall enable     # Enable recall, deploy the subagent and rules
teamai recall disable    # Disable recall, remove the subagent and rules
teamai recall status     # View the current effective status (team default + user override)
```

When disabled, `teamai pull` skips deploying the recall subagent, the recall rules injection block, and the TodoWrite reminder hook. Manually running `teamai recall <query>` to search is not affected by this switch.

## Commit Co-Author Attribution

AI coding tools stamp a `Co-Authored-By:` / attribution trailer on the commits they make. Teams that prefer a clean history can turn this off for everyone; individual members can still override it on their own machine. `teamai pull` applies the resolved intent to each installed tool's own config file.

The feature is controlled by the same two-tier pattern as recall:

| Tier | Config file | Field | Description |
|------|----------|------|------|
| Team default | `teamai.yaml` | `sharing.coAuthor.enabled` | `true` = keep the trailer / `false` = strip it. Omit the block entirely for "no opinion" (teamai touches nothing) |
| User override | `~/.teamai/config.yaml` | `coAuthorEnabled` | `true` / `false`, takes priority over the team default |

Per tool family, the trailer maps to a different setting:

| Tool family | File | Setting written | Scope | Reliability |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Claude (`claude`, `codebuddy`, `workbuddy`) | `settings.json` | `attribution.commit` / `attribution.pr` set to `""` | user **or** project (follows the active scope) | Deterministic |
| Codex (`codex`) | `~/.codex/config.toml` | `commit_attribution = ""` | user only | Best-effort — only takes effect when `[features].codex_git_commit = true`, which teamai does not force |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/cli-config.json` | `attribution.attributeCommitsToAgent = false` | user only | Best-effort — a [known upstream bug](https://forum.cursor.com/t/local-executor-ignores-cli-config-attribution-opt-out-forcing-co-authored-by-trailer/167722) can cause the local executor to ignore this |

Semantics:

- **Write-only, never delete.** Once teamai has written a value, dropping the team policy later leaves that value untouched — teamai never restores a trailer it stripped. To re-enable, set the intent back to `true` explicitly (which removes teamai's override so the tool's own default returns).
- **Idempotent.** teamai records what it last wrote per file (in `state.json` under `coAuthorManaged`) and skips a write when nothing would change.
- **Only installed tools are touched**, and existing keys/comments in each config file are preserved (key-level surgery, not regenerate-from-scratch).

Restart your AI tool session after a `pull` for the change to take effect.

## Team Culture

TeamAI supports injecting your team's culture into AI tools, so your AI coding assistant is aware of your team's culture, values, and coding standards in every session.

### Creating culture.md

The admin creates a `culture.md` file at the root of the team repo:

```markdown
---
company:
  name: Acme Corp
  mission: Build great things
  vision: A world where AI helps everyone
  values:
    - Innovation
    - Integrity
    - User First
team:
  name: Platform Team
  mission: Enable developers to ship faster
  goals:
    - Ship v2.0 by Q2
    - Improve test coverage to 90%
---

## Coding Standards

- All PRs must have at least one reviewer approval
- Direct pushes to master are prohibited
- Test coverage must be at least 80%

## Collaboration Norms

- Use conventional commits format
- PR descriptions must include ## Summary and ## Test Plan
- Major changes require a design doc first
```

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| `company.name` | string (required) | Company name |
| `company.mission` | string | Company mission |
| `company.vision` | string | Company vision |
| `company.values` | string[] | Company core values |
| `team.name` | string (required) | Team name |
| `team.mission` | string | Team mission |
| `team.goals` | string[] | Team goals |

The markdown body after the frontmatter becomes the body content of the team culture guidance, injected as a whole into `CLAUDE.md`.

### How it works

```
Team repo
├── culture.md          ← Maintained by admin
├── skills/
├── rules/
└── ...

teamai pull
    │
    ▼  Parse culture.md
    │  ├─ frontmatter → structured company/team info
    │  └─ body → team culture guidance body
    │
    ▼  Compile into a CLAUDE.md injection block
    │
    ▼  Inject into each AI tool's CLAUDE.md
       ├─ ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
       ├─ ~/.cursor/CLAUDE.md
       └─ ...
```

The injected content sits between the `<!-- [teamai:culture:start] -->` and `<!-- [teamai:culture:end] -->` markers, is automatically updated on every `pull`, and does not affect any other content in the file.

### Viewing the result

After pulling, you can view the AI tool's CLAUDE.md directly:

```bash
teamai pull
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

You'll see an injection block like this:

```markdown
<!-- [teamai:culture:start] -->
<!-- DO NOT EDIT: This section is auto-managed by teamai -->

## Team Culture (teamai)

## Company: Acme Corp
**Mission:** Build great things
**Vision:** A world where AI helps everyone
**Values:** Innovation, Integrity, User First

## Team: Platform Team
**Mission:** Enable developers to ship faster
**Goals:**
- Ship v2.0 by Q2
- Improve test coverage to 90%

## Coding Standards
- All PRs must have at least one reviewer approval
...
<!-- [teamai:culture:end] -->
```

## Advanced Features

### HTTP Contract (for backend implementers)

When using `teamai init --http <baseUrl>`, the endpoint must implement the following APIs (authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|------|------|------|
| `{baseUrl}/api/local-agent/report` | POST | Session start: upsert agent + installed skills |
| `{baseUrl}/api/local-agent/sync` | POST | Report status + return pending skill commands |
| `{baseUrl}/api/local-agent/commands/ack` | POST | Acknowledge a single command (`{ id, status, error }`) |

`POST /api/local-agent/sync` returns pending commands:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "commands": [{ "id": 1, "type": "install_skill", "skill_slug": "x", "skill_version": "1.0.0", "download_url": "https://signed-url/..." }]
}
```

The backend may also push an **`uninstall_teamai`** command to remove the local agent. It carries a `cmd` (a single `teamai` subcommand) that runs once on the client, with the result reported back through the same ack channel:

```json
{ "id": 42, "type": "uninstall_teamai", "cmd": "teamai uninstall --force --agent codebuddy" }
```

Security boundary for the executed `cmd`:

- **teamai subcommands only** — the first token must be exactly `teamai`; anything else is rejected (acked `failed`) and never executed. There is no arbitrary-shell surface.
- **No shell** — the command is run via `execFile` with the current Node binary and teamai entry script, so shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, …) are treated as literals and there is no PATH dependency (works inside sandboxes with a bundled Node).
- **On by default** — like install/uninstall commands, it runs automatically. Set `TEAMAI_DISABLE_REMOTE_CMD=1` on the client to reject it (acked `failed` with `remote cmd disabled by client`).
- **Timeout** — a hung command is killed after 120s and acked `failed`.

The backend may also push **`install_hook_rule`** / **`uninstall_hook_rule`** commands to remotely
manage a session hook in the **current reporting tool**'s settings, keyed by `slug`. The result is
reported over the same ack channel:

```jsonc
// install (or replace) a hook keyed by slug
{ "id": 50, "type": "install_hook_rule", "handle_type": "hook", "slug": "my-hook",
  "event": "SessionStart", "cmd": "echo hi", "timeout": 10 }

// uninstall the hook previously installed under slug
{ "id": 51, "type": "uninstall_hook_rule", "handle_type": "hook", "slug": "my-hook" }
```

Rules for agent hooks:

- **Current tool only** — the hook is written to the tool that is reporting (e.g. under Claude ⇒
  only `.claude/settings.json`). Other tools are never touched.
- **Supported tools** — `claude` / `codex` / `workbuddy` / `codebuddy` (plus their internal
  variants). **Cursor and OpenClaw-family tools are rejected** → acked `failed` (`unsupported tool`).
- **Event whitelist** — `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `Stop`.
  Any other event → acked `failed` (`unsupported event`).
- **Optional `matcher`** — a tool-name filter for `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse`; defaults to `*`
  (all tools) when omitted.
- **Default timeout 10s** when `timeout` is omitted; the backend value is honored when present.
- **Idempotent** — re-installing the same `slug` replaces the existing hook rather than duplicating
  it; `uninstall_hook_rule` for a missing `slug` is acked `success`.
- **Isolation** — agent hooks use a dedicated `[teamai:agent-hook:<slug>]` marker, so a team pull
  never deletes them and installing one never disturbs built-in or team hooks.
- **Teardown** — agent hooks are removed by `uninstall_hook_rule`, `teamai source remove`, and
  `teamai uninstall` (no residue in any tool's settings).
- **Kill-switch** — an agent hook is a backend-supplied command the tool auto-runs on its events,
  so it shares the `uninstall_teamai` trust model: setting `TEAMAI_DISABLE_REMOTE_CMD=1` on the
  client rejects `install_hook_rule` / `uninstall_hook_rule` too (acked `failed`).
- **Codex matching** — codex settings carry no description field, so codex agent hooks are matched
  by their exact command and the local-agent manifest is the authoritative record for their
  teardown. Backends should use a **unique `cmd` per codex `slug`** so replace/remove stay precise.

Configurable environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `TEAMAI_API_TOKEN` | API key (alternative to `--token`) |
| `TEAMAI_REPORT_ENDPOINT` | Reporter base URL (defaults to the `--http` address) |
| `TEAMAI_REPORT_PATHS` | JSON `{ "report", "sync", "ack" }`, overrides the three paths |
| `TEAMAI_REPORT_AGENTS` | Comma-separated list of agents that report (default `workbuddy,codebuddy`) |
| `TEAMAI_SKILL_DOWNLOAD_HOSTS` | Allowlist of hosts for skill `download_url` (empty = allow all) |
| `TEAMAI_ALLOW_SANDBOX_REPORT` | Set to `1` to force report/sync inside a CloudStudio sandbox (see note below) |
| `TEAMAI_DISABLE_REMOTE_CMD` | Set to `1` to reject server-pushed `uninstall_teamai`, `install_hook_rule`, and `uninstall_hook_rule` commands (they are acked `failed`) |
| `TEAMAI_SKIP_AST` | Set to `1` to force heuristic-only code extraction, skipping the WASM tree-sitter AST track |

> **Privacy:** The install path and machine id are only hashed locally to derive `local_agent_id` — they are never reported.

> **CloudStudio sandbox:** When WorkBuddy runs teamai hooks inside a CloudStudio container, that container has a
> different machine id than the macOS host and would report a duplicate agent card. The duplicate report is therefore
> skipped automatically inside a CloudStudio sandbox (sync still runs, so pushed commands are still received) —
> detected via `X_IDE_IS_CLOUDSTUDIO=TRUE` or the `/var/run/cloudstudio` directory.
> Set `TEAMAI_ALLOW_SANDBOX_REPORT=1` to opt back in if you run teamai exclusively inside CloudStudio.

### Codebase Knowledge Graph

`teamai import` parses a source code repo into a structured knowledge graph (stored under the team repo's `teamwiki/` directory), enabling structure-aware knowledge retrieval:

```bash
# Extract from a local directory
teamai import --dir /path/to/project

# Import from a remote repo
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo

# Bulk-import all repos under an organization
teamai import --from-org myorg

# Bulk-import from an allowlist
teamai import --from-repo-list repos.yaml

# Extract learnings from a merged MR/PR
teamai import --from-mr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123

# Import docs from iWiki
teamai import --from-iwiki 12345

# Incremental mode (skip unchanged files)
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo --incremental

# Extract structure only, skip AI enrichment
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo --skip-enrich
```

The graph stores components, interfaces, configs, and cross-repo dependencies. `teamai recall` uses the graph for BM25 + graph-boosted ranking.

Dependency edges are extracted by two parallel tracks: a WASM tree-sitter **AST track** (TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go) that resolves imports, calls, and TS `implements` clauses to precise file-to-file edges (`code-ast`), and a regex **heuristic track** (all languages, `code-heuristic`) that also covers languages the AST track does not. AST results win on overlap. The AST parser needs no native toolchain; on load failure, extraction falls back to heuristics and records an `AST_UNAVAILABLE` gap. Set `TEAMAI_SKIP_AST=1` to force heuristic-only extraction.

```bash
# Graph health check
teamai codebase --lint
```

### Dashboard

```bash
teamai dashboard             # Start the web dashboard (default port 3721)
teamai dashboard --port 8080
```

View team members' AI coding session status in real time.

#### Human Intervention Metrics

Each session card shows a `⚠ N` badge, counting the **number of human interventions** in that conversation — fewer interventions means the agent is better at getting things right on the first try. Hover to see a breakdown; each of the three signal types counts once:

| Type | Meaning | Data source |
|------|------|----------|
| `interrupt` | User pressed ESC to interrupt the agent mid-execution | An interrupted turn in the transcript |
| `toolReject` | User rejected a tool call (permission deny) | A tool_result marked as rejected in the transcript |
| `correction` | Within 60s after the agent stops, the user submits a follow-up prompt containing a correction keyword ("not right" / "redo" / "wrong" / etc.) | The stop → prompt_submit event pattern |

> Privacy: only counts are tracked — no prompt or transcript text is ever stored.

Intervention data is automatically aggregated and reported to the team's `stats/<user>.yaml` during `teamai pull`, and shown in the "Session Autonomy" leaderboard of `teamai digest`, with team averages and per-person intervention rate rankings — useful for verifying whether a skill/rule reduces intervention rates after rollout. Tools without a transcript (e.g. Cursor) degrade gracefully, tracking only `correction`.

#### Conversation Volume & Token Usage

Each session card also shows two badges:

| Badge | Meaning | Data source |
|------|------|----------|
| `💬 N` | The **number of human conversation turns** in the session (how many prompts were sent) | Count of `UserPromptSubmit` events |
| `⛁ X` | The session's cumulative **token usage** (hover to see input / output / cache read / cache write breakdown) | Claude Code transcript's `message.usage` (deduplicated by `message.id` to avoid double counting) |

> Privacy: only turn counts and token counts are tracked — no prompt or transcript text is ever stored.

These two metrics are likewise aggregated into `stats/<user>.yaml` (as `prompts` and `tokens` fields) during `teamai pull`, and shown in the "Conversation Volume & Token Usage" section of `teamai digest`, with team-wide totals, bucketed token totals, and per-person token usage rankings. Tools without transcript access (e.g. Cursor) degrade gracefully: turn counts are still tracked, while tokens show as 0 / N/A.

### Session Save

`teamai session save` folds the dashboard's existing per-session event stream (tool sequence, prompt turns, interventions) into a compact, privacy-scrubbed markdown summary — no LLM call, no new collection path.

```bash
teamai session save                    # record the most-recent session locally
teamai session save --session-id <id>  # record a specific session
teamai session save --push             # also push a "valuable" session to the team repo
teamai session save --push --force     # push even a trivial session
teamai session save --push --include-prompt  # also include the (redacted) first-ask line
```

**Local (always):** appends to `~/.teamai/session-logs/<year-month>.md`. Idempotent per session (a session already recorded that month is skipped), and logs older than 90 days are pruned automatically.

**Team (`--push`, opt-in):** commits the summary directly (no PR) to `sessions/<user>/<year-month>.md` in the team repo — the exact path `teamai digest` reads, so the session shows up under **Session Highlights**. Only a **valuable** session is pushed by default: one that shows friction (an interrupt / tool-reject / correction) or substantial tool use (≥ 3 distinct tools). Trivial sessions stay local unless you pass `--force`. On a read-only (HTTP-mode) team, `--push` fails gracefully and the local log is still kept.

> Privacy: the team-pushed payload is **counts + tool names only** by default. The first-ask prompt line is opt-in via `--include-prompt`, and even then it is run through the same secret redaction (`ghp_…` → `<REDACTED:…>`) used elsewhere. Local logs keep the redacted first-ask line since they never leave your machine.

### Hooks

Hooks automatically injected by `teamai init`:

| Hook Event | Action |
|-----------|------|
| `SessionStart` | Seed the current agent's project root (project scope), then auto pull + report session start |
| `PostToolUse` | Skill tracking + knowledge contribution detection + dashboard reporting |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Slash command tracking |
| `Stop` | CLI update check + report session end |

```bash
teamai hooks inject    # Re-inject
teamai hooks remove    # Remove
```

Both commands only touch tools you actually have installed (i.e. whose `~/.<tool>/` root directory already exists). They never create root directories for tools listed in `toolPaths` but not installed.

> **Codex trust gate** — Codex (the OpenAI / ChatGPT Codex app, tool id `codex`) gates non-managed hooks behind an explicit user trust step. After teamai writes `~/.codex/hooks.json`, Codex may skip a newly added or changed hook until you review/trust it in `/hooks` or Settings → Hooks. `teamai hooks inject` and `teamai doctor` print a reminder when Codex hooks are installed; teamai never edits Codex's `[hooks.state]` to auto-trust — trusting is left to you. (The internal variants `codex-internal` / `tcodex` share the hooks.json format but have no trust gate, so no reminder is shown for them.)

### Team Hooks Declaration

A team can declare custom hooks in the repo's `hooks/hooks.yaml`; `teamai pull` automatically distributes them to all members' AI tools:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: block-secret
    description: Scan for secrets before commit
    event: PreToolUse
    matcher: Bash
    command: 'bash -lc "~/.teamai/team-scripts/scan-secret.sh" || true'
    timeout: 15
    tools: [claude, cursor]

builtin:
  disabled: [Hook dispatch post-tool-use TodoWrite]
  overrides:
    Hook dispatch stop: { timeout: 20 }
```

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| `id` | Unique identifier, `^[a-z0-9-]+$` |
| `event` | Claude PascalCase event name (shared across tools) |
| `matcher` | Optional tool matcher |
| `tools` | Optional list of target tools (default = all tools that support hooks) |
| `builtin.disabled` | List of disabled built-in hooks |
| `builtin.overrides` | Only the `timeout` of a built-in hook can be overridden |

Security governance:
- `sharing.hooks.autoApply: false` (`teamai.yaml`): on pull, only prompts — requires manually confirming with `teamai hooks inject`
- `sharing.hooks.requireTeamScripts: true`: rejects any hook whose command isn't under `~/.teamai/team-scripts/`
- `TEAMAI_HOOKS_DISABLED=1`: disables all team hooks locally (built-in hooks are unaffected)

### Agents Resource Type

The team repo can maintain custom subagent definitions under an `agents/` directory (one `*.md` file per agent):

```text
team-repo/
  agents/
    code-reviewer.md      # Team custom subagent
    .removed              # tombstone (auto-managed by teamai remove agents <name>)
```

`teamai pull` copies these into each Tier-1 tool's `agents/` directory (e.g. `~/.claude/agents/`). The CLI's built-in `teamai-recall.md` is deployed alongside team agents but is not uploaded by `teamai push`.

### OpenCode

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) is supported as a first-class tool. Because its config layout differs from the Claude family, teamai handles a few things specially:

- **Scopes.** OpenCode's user config lives under `~/.config/opencode/` while its project config lives under `<project>/.opencode/` — a different prefix from every other tool. teamai writes to the correct one per `--scope`, and only ever touches OpenCode files when OpenCode is actually installed for that scope (it never creates `~/.config/opencode/` for a non-user). Hooks are the one exception — they are always user-scoped, for the reason described below.
- **Skills** land in `.opencode/skills/` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/skills/` (user). OpenCode also reads `.claude/skills` natively, but teamai writes the OpenCode path too so an OpenCode-only user still gets them.
- **Subagents** are rendered into OpenCode's own `agents/*.md` format: frontmatter carries `description` + `mode: subagent` (plus `model` and any `tool_extras.opencode` fields such as `temperature`); the agent name comes from the filename. OpenCode does **not** read `.claude/agents`, so this native copy is required.
- **Rules** are copied into `.opencode/rules/` (or `~/.config/opencode/rules/`), but OpenCode does not auto-scan a rules directory — the files are inert until referenced. teamai therefore adds a `rules/*.md` glob to the `instructions` array in `opencode.json` and removes it again when the team's last rule goes away, editing only that one key and leaving your own `instructions` entries untouched.
- **Hooks** are delivered as an OpenCode *plugin*, not a settings-file entry — OpenCode has no `hooks` array; it auto-loads JS/TS plugins from **both** `~/.config/opencode/plugin/` and `<project>/.opencode/plugin/`. A plugin present in both dirs is loaded twice and would dispatch every event twice, so teamai keeps exactly one copy: `teamai-hooks.ts` in the user dir, which covers every project. Any project-scope copy left by an earlier layout is deleted on the next sync. This matches the other tools, whose `settings.json` hooks also live in HOME and gate on the `cwd` handed to `hook-dispatch`. The plugin subscribes to OpenCode's own events and shelling out to the same `teamai hook-dispatch` entry point every other tool uses. The event mapping mirrors the Claude built-in set: `session.created` → session-start, `session.idle` → stop, `chat.message` → prompt-submit, `tool.execute.after` → post-tool-use. The plugin forwards the same STDIN payload other agents send (`cwd`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `prompt`), and maps OpenCode's lowercase tool ids (`skill`, `todowrite`) back to the PascalCase matchers the handler registry expects. OpenCode cannot inject a hook's stdout back into the session, so hooks run purely for their side effects (status report / sync / update). Note that OpenCode *awaits* its named hooks (`chat.message`, `tool.execute.after`), so those dispatches briefly wait on the `teamai` subprocess before the agent continues; the errors are always swallowed so a hook can never fail the session. Server-pushed agent hooks (`teamai-agent-<slug>.ts`) install into the same user plugin dir.
- **MCP** servers live under the `mcp` key of the shared `opencode.json` (see the MCP section above).

### Cursor

Cursor project rules must live in `.cursor/rules/` as **`.mdc`** files with YAML frontmatter — a plain `.md` file there is silently ignored by Cursor. teamai therefore writes rules to Cursor as `<name>.mdc` (every other tool still gets a plain `.md`), deriving the frontmatter from the team rule:

- A rule scoped with a `paths:` list becomes `globs: "<comma-joined>"` + `alwaysApply: false` (Cursor auto-attaches it when a matching file is in context). The value is quoted because a glob starting with `*` is not valid YAML unquoted.
- A rule with no `paths` (a mandatory team rule) becomes `alwaysApply: true` (applied to every Cursor chat session).

Only the markdown body crosses between the two formats; each side keeps its own frontmatter. On `pull` the Cursor frontmatter is machine-derived (the body is copied over with leading/trailing blank lines normalized), so a `pull` → `push` round-trip is not seen as a content change. On `push`, editing a rule's body in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` and running `teamai push` sends **only that body** upstream — the team rule keeps its own `paths:` frontmatter, so the rule's scope is never silently lost.

Two things are deliberately *not* pushed from Cursor's rules directory:

- A `.mdc` file with no matching team rule. `.cursor/rules/` is also where Cursor's own *New Cursor Rule* command writes personal rules, so teamai never offers those as new team resources.
- The CLI built-in rules, which are deployed (as `.mdc` for Cursor) rather than synced.

Upgrading from an earlier version: `.cursor/rules/*.md` copies written by the old layout are inert — Cursor never read them — so `pull`, `remove`, and `uninstall` delete them alongside the `.mdc` file. A `.md` you put there yourself is left alone.

### Miscellaneous

```bash
teamai doctor          # Config diagnostics
teamai stats           # Skill usage stats
teamai update          # CLI update
teamai remove skills <name>   # Remove a resource
teamai remove rules <name>
teamai remove wiki <name>
```

Auto-update runs in the Stop hook and is controlled by two tiers:

| Tier | File | Field | Value |
|------|------|------|------|
| Team default | `teamai.yaml` | `autoUpdate` | `true` (default) / `false` |
| User override | `~/.teamai/config.yaml` | `updatePolicy` | `auto` / `prompt` / `skip` |

The user-level `updatePolicy` always takes priority over the team-level `autoUpdate`.

### CI Integration

`teamai ci extract-mr` plugs into your CI pipeline, automatically extracting knowledge from every MR/PR:

```bash
# Comment mode: post suggestions as comments (runs when the MR/PR is opened/updated)
teamai ci extract-mr --url "$MR_URL" --mode comment --individual-comments

# Write mode: after merge, write approved suggestions into the knowledge base
teamai ci extract-mr --url "$MR_URL" --mode write --team-repo ./team-repo --individual-comments
```

Workflow:

1. MR opened/updated → CI triggers `--mode comment`, extracts knowledge suggestions and posts them as MR comments
2. Reviewer reviews the comments, marking unwanted suggestions as rejected (GitHub 👎 / TGit ☝️)
3. MR merged → CI triggers `--mode write`, writing non-rejected suggestions into the team knowledge repo

Ready-to-use templates:

- `examples/ci/github-actions-mr-extract.yml` (GitHub Actions)
- `examples/ci/coding-ci-mr-extract.yaml` (Coding CI / TGit)

### Cross-Team Skill Subscriptions

`teamai source` lets you subscribe to other teams' public skill repos, automatically fetching the latest skills on `pull`:

```bash
# Add a subscription source
teamai source add https://github.com/other-team/teamai-public.git --name other-team

# List subscriptions
teamai source list

# Browse a subscription's skills
teamai source browse other-team

# Remove a subscription (also cleans up its skills)
teamai source remove other-team
```

A subscription source's skills are automatically synced locally on `teamai pull`, coexisting with the team's own skills. `teamai source add`/`remove` updates the active scope's team repo immediately, so local `list`, `browse`, and `pull` commands use the change before it is committed. The subscription itself is stored in the `sources` field of that repo's `teamai.yaml`. Run `teamai push` to open a PR with the config change; once it merges, every teammate's `teamai pull` picks up the new source automatically.

#### HTTP Source

In addition to a git subscription source, you can attach an HTTP source on top of an existing git main repo — useful for server-managed skill delivery:

```bash
# Attach an HTTP source (the git main repo is unaffected)
teamai source add-http https://your-team-host/api --token <api-key>

# View it (shown under "HTTP source")
teamai source list

# Detach and uninstall its resources
teamai source remove-http
```

An HTTP source reports status and pulls skill commands via hook dispatch on every session. Only one HTTP source is supported per install. If the main repo is already in HTTP mode (`init --http`), `add-http` is unavailable (the main repo already occupies the HTTP config).

## Configuration Reference

### teamai.yaml (remote team config)

```yaml
team: my-team
description: Team AI resource repo
repo: https://github.com/group/repo.git
provider: github
# scope: ignored if present — local install location is set by `teamai init --scope`

reviewers:
  - reviewer1

sharing:
  rules:
    enforced: [code-review-guide]
  docs:
    localDir: ./.teamai/docs
  env:
    injectShellProfile: true
  coAuthor:
    enabled: false             # optional; strip AI-tool commit trailers team-wide
```

### config.yaml (local config)

```yaml
repo:
  localPath: /path/to/.teamai/team-repo
  remote: https://github.com/group/repo.git
username: your-name
updatePolicy: auto
scope: project                 # project (default from init) or user
projectRoot: /path/to/project  # project scope only
inheritUserScope: true         # optional; project scope only, defaults to false
coAuthorEnabled: true          # optional; per-machine co-author override
```

## Uninstall

`teamai uninstall` intelligently cleans up all teamai-managed resources, **preserving anything you created yourself**.

```bash
# Preview every managed path that will be removed (no actual changes)
teamai uninstall --dry-run

# Interactive confirmation
teamai uninstall

# Skip confirmation and uninstall directly (for scripts/CI)
teamai uninstall --force

# Uninstall only one tool's resources (mirrors `init --agent`)
teamai uninstall --agent claude
```

What gets removed:
- teamai hooks in AI tool settings
- The teamai rules block in CLAUDE.md (your own content is preserved)
- Team-synced skills, including OpenClaw workspace skills (your own skills are preserved)
- Team-synced rules
- Team-synced custom agents and CLI built-in agents (your own agents are preserved)
- The env block in your shell profile
- The `~/.teamai/` directory

### Uninstall a single tool (`--agent <tool>`)

`--agent <tool>` removes only that tool's teamai resources (hooks, CLAUDE.md block, skills, rules, team-synced custom agents, and built-in agents). The tool name is a key of `toolPaths` (e.g. `claude`, `codex`, `codebuddy`) and is matched case-insensitively. An unknown tool name aborts without deleting anything, lists the available tools, and exits with a non-zero status.

Shared resources (the env block, docs directory, and `~/.teamai/`) are removed **only when the target itself has teamai resources AND is the last tool still using teamai** — otherwise they are kept for the remaining tools. (So targeting a tool that has no teamai resources of its own is a no-op and leaves shared resources in place, even if it happens to be the only tool.)

The exclusion is durable: `uninstall --agent <tool>` drops the tool from `enabledAgents` and records it in `disabledAgents`, so a later `pull` (or another tool's session-start hook) will not resurrect its skills, rules, agents, CLAUDE.md block, or hooks. Running `init --agent <tool>` again clears the exclusion and re-enables sync for that tool.

To rejoin after uninstalling:

```bash
teamai init --repo <group>/TeamAi-<team> --scope user --role <role_id> --force
teamai pull
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can user scope and project scope coexist?**

Yes, but project scope remains isolated by default. When the current working directory contains a project-scope config, it is active and user scope is skipped. Initialize user scope first, then initialize the project with `--inherit-user-scope` (or set `inheritUserScope: true` in the project's local config) to compose safe resources and Recall results. Executable and control-plane configuration (`env`, MCP) remains project-only; hooks are the exception — a non-self project scope injects them into HOME so `hook-dispatch` can gate on `cwd` (see the Hooks section).

**Q: `teamai init` says it's already initialized?**

In interactive mode, you'll be asked whether to overwrite — type `y` to confirm. You can also use `--force` to skip the confirmation:

```bash
teamai init --repo <group>/<repo> --force
```

**Q: After `teamai init` in a project, there is no `.claude/` (or `.cursor/`, `.codebuddy/`) directory?**

That is expected. `init` does not know which agent you will open. Open Claude Code / Cursor / CodeBuddy in the project: the SessionStart hook creates that tool's project root and then pulls. A bare `teamai pull` will not create missing agent roots.

**Q: Hooks aren't firing automatically?**

```bash
teamai doctor        # Diagnose
teamai hooks inject  # Re-inject
```

**Q: `push` says "no new resources detected"?**

`push` only detects new or modified resources. If nothing changed, there's nothing to push.

**Q: How do I delete resources that were already pushed?**

```bash
teamai remove skills <name>
teamai remove rules <name>
```
